# lah-scanner
Python pipeline for 3D loudspeaker measurement and sound field reconstruction. Processes impulse responses on a spatial grid, performs spherical harmonic expansion (SHE), separates internal/external sound fields, and evaluates complex pressures at arbitrary points for visualization or FRD export.
